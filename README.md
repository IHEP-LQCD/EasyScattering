# EasyScattering

## Introduction
`EasyScattering` project is developed to integrate the finite volume two-body scattering using `Python` within the framework of lattice QCD.

## Features
    - **Reimann Zeta funtion** (not complete).
    - **Coupled-Channel Parametrization**.
    - **getting `chi2`.**

## Getting Started
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/IHEP-LQCD/EasyScattering
    python control_*.py
```

## How to Contribute
This project are build at very early stage. Welcome to build it together.

## TODO:
    - coupled-channel parametiration tunning.
    - higher partral wave mixing effect.
